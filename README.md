1. The cDE-emc-um algorithm is contained in the `cDE-emc-um.zip` file and can be run directly using C++. 

2. The `cDE-emc-um for two benchmatk function in FPGA.zip` file contains the FPGA implementation of the cDE-emc-um algorithm for different benchmark test functions, including the hardware implementation of the cDE-emc-um algorithm. The `.sdk` folder contains the program in ARM that calls cDE-emc-um, UnSS, and UnOF. 

3. The `cDE-emc-um for two problems in FPGA.zip` file contains a unified implementation of the cDE-emc-um algorithm for two different problems, including the hardware implementation of UnSS and UnOF. The `.sdk` file implements the unified packaging of data, which processes different problems in a unified manner.
